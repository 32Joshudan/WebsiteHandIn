        <p class= "description-p">Short Reflective Essay <br><br><br>When starting the Graphic and Web Design Module, I had little to no experience with what was being taught to us, nor I had any idea what was going to be taught to us. 
            <br><br>I went into this module mostly keen on the web development side, having a little bit of knowledge on HTML and CSS beforehand by going through my Computer Science A-Level at Sixth Form, but never had a chance to use it properly as it wasn’t a very deep look into the subject, and the topic was cut from the exam. This was where I found the worksheets very handy, as they very were simple to follow and understand, although I did run into my own set of shortcomings and errors along the way. It allowed me to relearn and go through familiar material more slowly and steadily, further cementing what was taught to me in my head. I particularly found Flexbox, and the use of Adobe and Google fonts interesting and wanted to integrate them into my website. 
            <br><br>I found the use of GitHub, Desktop and Pages to be quite innovative, as I have heard of their names and had some familiarity with what they were used for, but I’ve grown accustomed to them and find them very useful, especially when coding my own website.
            <br><br>At first, I thought what was being taught to us about Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity was simple, which I think has to do with the fact that it is so commonplace in most sights I visit. However, combined with my unfamiliarity with InDesign, and most other Adobe apps aside from Photoshop, I found that this was a part of Graphic Design I took for granted, as it took really active thinking on where I was supposed to place my text and images, and what size they were going to be on my poster. My major struggle with this part of the module was probably using InDesign, which though I did find difficult, I was determined that I was going to learn what I needed for this part of the module, by virtue of trial and error, online tutorials , forum posts, and in-person help from teachers. There were some parts of the posters I wasn’t proud of, and thought that if I was better at InDesign, I could’ve done better, but as of writing this it is near the deadline of the 5 Day grace period, and eventually, I knew that my skills and knowledge on InDesign and CARP improved, as my 3rd poster is one I am genuinely proud of.
            <br><br>The same could be said for typography, there were some typographic systems I underestimated, and some of them I’ve never seen before and found interesting. My general weakness with this part of the module was my unfamiliarity with Illustrator, but like what I said with InDesign, I found that I got there eventually through trial and error, online help, and in-person teaching.
            <br><br>I eventually started to use colour for my typography posters around the time I started with my site, which I already preestablished that it should have a Red, Black and White colour scheme.
            <br><br>Overall, I am proud and confident in my abilities and knowledge I have gained throughout this module.
